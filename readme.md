# VSlice of Life
Simple additions for your copy of Friday Night Funkin'!
* You can now see your rank mid-song instead of only knowing after the song/week ends. Shows both song and week rank if not in the first song of a week.
* The player characters freeplay icon is now visible for the fun of it really. It also reacts to your current rank!
* You can see the song's capsule from the pause menu! You can even press your `FAVORITE` bind and it'll work like normal.

***MOBILE WAS NOT IN MIND WHEN MAKING THIS MOD!*** Though it will be accounted for in a future update.

Plans:
* Options for song restart if your rank drops.
* *Proper* mobile support.

Bugs:
* Figure why sometimes none of the objects get added (I had to do some recursive bullshit to counteract this, but that's stupid).
* Fix the rank and heart assets for the capsule in the pause menu being wierd.
